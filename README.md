# Aberdeen City Council Chatbot

## 🏛️ Project Overview

The **Aberdeen City Council Chatbot** is an AI-driven solution designed to simplify user navigation through Aberdeen City Council's vast range of services. This chatbot helps users easily access critical information related to housing, council tax, loss of income, mental health, and more, directly from the council's website.

By leveraging AI-powered interactions, the chatbot not only provides users with accurate answers but also references the exact source of the information, ensuring transparency and trustworthiness.
